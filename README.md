# Gatsby starter for Silverstripe CMS

## Before you start

Make sure you have the [silverstripe-gatsby](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-gatsby) module
installed on your Silverstripe backend.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the Silverstripe CMS starter
    gatsby new my-silverstripe-starter https://github.com/silverstripe/gatsby-starter-silverstripe
    ```

2.  **Configure**

```shell
yarn setup
```

3.  **Start me up**

Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

```shell
cd my-silverstripe-starter/
yarn develop
```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    You should now see your Silverstripe CMS website in a default theme running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-silverstripe-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
